## ‚ú® Feature 3: Bidding System for Appointments

### Backend Changes:

#### 1. **Property Model** (`models/Property.js`)
```javascript
bids: [{
    bidder: ObjectId (ref: User),
    amount: Number,
    createdAt: Date
}],
minimumBid: Number (default: 0)
```

#### 2. **Appointment Model** (`models/Appointment.js`)
```javascript
bidAmount: Number (required, default: 0)
```

#### 3. **New API Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/properties/:id/bid` - Place a bid on a property
- `GET /api/properties/:id/bids` - Get all bids for a property (sorted by highest first)
- `GET /api/properties/:id/appointments` - Get existing appointments

#### 4. **Controller Functions** (`propertyController.js`)
- `placeBid()` - Validates and records bids
- `getPropertyBids()` - Returns bids with highest bid info
- `getPropertyAppointments()` - Returns active appointments

#### 5. **Appointment Controller Updates** (`appointmentController.js`)
- Modified `createAppointment()` to:
  - Require `bidAmount` parameter
  - Validate bid meets minimum requirement
  - Check bid is competitive (within 90% of highest bid)
  - Store bid amount with appointment

### Frontend Changes:

#### **BookingModal Component** (`BookingModal.jsx`)
Enhanced with comprehensive bidding features:

1. **Bidding Information Panel:**
   - Displays minimum bid requirement
   - Shows current highest bid
   - Warning message about competitive bidding

2. **Existing Appointments Display:**
   - Lists all active appointments
   - Shows date, time, status, and bid amount for each
   - Color-coded badges for status

3. **Bid Amount Input Field:**
   - Required field for booking
   - Auto-suggests competitive bid (5% higher than highest)
   - Real-time validation
   - Shows minimum and highest bid as helper text

4. **Enhanced Validation:**
   - Ensures bid meets minimum requirement
   - Prevents booking without competitive bid

#### **Appointments Page** (`Appointments.jsx`)
- Now displays bid amount for each appointment
- Styled with green color for visibility

### How Bidding Works:

1. **Seller Sets Minimum Bid** (when creating property)
   - Optional field during property creation
   - Defaults to 0 if not set

2. **Buyer Views Property & Opens Booking Modal**
   - Sees bidding information panel
   - Reviews existing appointments and their bid amounts
   - Gets suggested bid amount (slightly higher than current highest)

3. **Buyer Places Bid & Books Appointment**
   - Enters bid amount
   - System validates:
     - Bid >= minimum bid
     - Bid is competitive (>= 90% of highest bid)
   - Books appointment with bid amount

4. **Seller Reviews Appointments**
   - Sees all appointments with bid amounts
   - Can prioritize highest bidders for confirmation
   - Can confirm/decline based on bid competitiveness

## üîí Business Rules

### Bidding Rules:
1. **Minimum Bid:** Must meet property's minimum bid requirement
2. **Competitive Bidding:** Bid should be at least 90% of current highest bid
3. **No Self-Bidding:** Cannot bid on own properties
4. **Transparency:** All users see highest bid (not individual bids)

### Appointment Priority:
- Sellers are encouraged to prioritize highest bidders
- System shows bid amounts to help sellers make decisions
- Buyers are informed that higher bids get priority

---

## üé® UI/UX Improvements

### Visual Enhancements:
- **Color-coded badges** for appointment status
- **Green highlighting** for bid amounts
- **Warning indicators** for bidding requirements
- **Scrollable lists** for many appointments
- **Responsive layout** for all screen sizes
- **Loading states** for better user feedback

### User Feedback:
- Toast notifications for all actions
- Validation error messages
- Helper text with current bid info
- Clear labels and icons

---

## üìä Database Schema Changes

### Property Collection:
```javascript
{
  // ...existing fields
  bids: [
    {
      bidder: ObjectId,
      amount: Number,
      createdAt: Date
    }
  ],
  minimumBid: Number
}
```

### Appointment Collection:
```javascript
{
  // ...existing fields
  bidAmount: Number (required)
}
```

## üöÄ API Endpoints Summary

### New Endpoints:
1. `GET /api/properties/my-listings` - Get user's listed properties
2. `POST /api/properties/:id/bid` - Place a bid (protected)
3. `GET /api/properties/:id/bids` - Get property bids (public)
4. `GET /api/properties/:id/appointments` - Get property appointments (public)

### Modified Endpoints:
1. `POST /api/appointments` - Now requires `bidAmount` parameter

## üß™ Testing Recommendations

### Test Scenarios:
1. **Seller Views Listings:**
   - Login as seller
   - Navigate to Properties
   - Toggle to "My Listings"
   - Verify only seller's properties appear

2. **View Existing Appointments:**
   - Open booking modal for a property with appointments
   - Verify appointments list is displayed
   - Check date/time/bid formatting

3. **Place Bid & Book:**
   - Try booking with bid below minimum (should fail)
   - Try booking with competitive bid (should succeed)
   - Verify bid appears in seller's appointments view

4. **Bidding Edge Cases:**
   - Try bidding on own property (should be prevented)
   - Try booking without bid amount (should fail)
   - Verify highest bid calculations

---

## üìù Notes for Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements:
1. **Auto-approve highest bidder** after certain time
2. **Bid history tracking** for transparency
3. **Notification system** when outbid
4. **Reserve price** (hidden minimum)
5. **Bid increment rules** (e.g., minimum +$1000)
6. **Time-limited bidding** (auction-style)
7. **Counter-offers** from sellers
8. **Earnest money** integration

### Security Considerations:
- Implement rate limiting for bid placement
- Add bid verification for large amounts
- Consider bid bonds for serious buyers
- Add audit trail for all bidding activity
