For testing, we'll use the default (0) which allows any positive bid.

     - Highest Bid: "No bids yet" (if first bidder)
     - Warning message about competitive bidding
   
2. **Enter Details:**

   - Fill in phone (optional) and notes (optional)
   - Click "Confirm Booking"

3. **Expected Result:**

   - Email confirmation sent
   - Appointment created with bid amount

4. **As Buyer 2:**
   - Open the same property's booking modal
   - **Expected to see:**
     - Bidding Information shows:
       - Minimum Bid: $0
       - Highest Bid: $10,000 (from Buyer 1)
     - Existing Appointments section shows Buyer 1's appointment with $10,000 bid
   
5. **Try Low Bid (Should Fail):**
   - Enter $5,000 as bid (less than 90% of $10,000)
   - Try to submit
   - **Expected:** Error message: "Your bid should be competitive. Current highest bid is $10,000"

6. **Place Higher Bid (Should Succeed):**

   - **Bid Amount displayed in green:** 
     - "Bid Amount: $10,000" for Buyer 1
     - "Bid Amount: $11,000" for Buyer 2
   - All appointment details (date, time, status)

5. **As Seller, Confirm Highest Bidder:**
   - Look for Buyer 2's appointment (with $11,000 bid)

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "My Listings" shows all properties
**Solution:** 
- Check if user is properly authenticated
- Verify JWT token is valid
- Check backend `/api/properties/my-listings` endpoint

### Issue 2: Existing appointments not showing
**Solution:**
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify property ID is correct
- Check if appointments exist in database
- Ensure appointment status is 'pending' or 'confirmed'

### Issue 3: Bid validation not working
**Solution:**
- Check if bidAmount is being sent as a number (not string)
- Verify property has bids array in database
- Check backend validation logic in appointmentController.js

### Issue 4: Auto-suggested bid is NaN
**Solution:**
- Ensure property.price exists
- Check bidsInfo is properly loaded
- Verify minimumBid is a number

## Database Verification Queries

If using MongoDB Compass or mongosh:

### Check Property Bids:
```javascript
db.properties.findOne(
  { _id: ObjectId("...") },
  { bids: 1, minimumBid: 1 }
)
```

### Check Appointment Bid Amounts:
```javascript
db.appointments.find(
  { property: ObjectId("...") },
  { buyer: 1, bidAmount: 1, status: 1, appointmentDate: 1 }
)
```

### Set Minimum Bid for Property:
```javascript
db.properties.updateOne(
  { _id: ObjectId("...") },
  { $set: { minimumBid: 5000 } }
)
```

## Expected Console Logs

### Successful Bid Placement:
```
âœ“ Appointment booked successfully! Check your email for confirmation.
```

### Failed Bid (Too Low):
```
âœ— Your bid should be competitive. Current highest bid is $10,000
```

### Failed Bid (Below Minimum):
```
âœ— Bid must be at least $5,000
```
